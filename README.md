#NOTICE
The Current Code Won't Work As They Have Added A reCaptcha on their website and it won't be possible to bypass that.
Will try to improve the code, so that the user is prompted to enter the reCaptcha and then the downlading will continue. Although this might seem to destroy the purpose of a downloader, it's the best can be done.
#NOTICE ENDS

This code is used to download a batch of all episodes of a specific Anime from the website: 9anime.to

This repo requiers an external downloader agent : uGet, which is freely available.
It currently only works for Linux (tested on Ubuntu)

Before running the repo use :


*sudo apt-get install uget*    #to get the uget downloader

*sudo apt-get install python-qt4* #to get the gui api

*sudo pip install selenium*	#to get the selenium webdrivers

*sudo apt-get install chromium-browser* #to get the chromium browser (It requires the chromium browser to access the site)

run:

*chmod +x dnld_support.sh*  #to allow executable permissions to the script


Then run the anime_downloader.py, enter the required details to get the anime downloaded
