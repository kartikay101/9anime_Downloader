THEY JUST REMOVED THE CAPTCHA AND THE POPUP ADS, maybe beacuse of reduced traffic on their website because of those.
Anyways the downloader works as it used to, report any issues and they will be sorted ASAP. Thanks for using this code

This code is used to download a batch of all episodes of a specific Anime from the website: 9anime.to

This repo requiers an external downloader agent : uGet, which is freely available.
It currently only works for Linux (tested on Ubuntu)

Before running the repo use :


*sudo apt-get install uget*    #to get the uget downloader

*sudo apt-get install python-qt4* #to get the gui api

*sudo pip install selenium*	#to get the selenium webdrivers

*sudo apt-get install chromium-browser* #to get the chromium browser (It requires the chromium browser to access the site)

run:

*chmod +x dnld_support.sh*  #to allow executable permissions to the script


Then run the anime_downloader.py, enter the required details to get the anime downloaded
