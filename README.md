This code is used to download a batch of all episodes of a specific Anime from the website: 9anime.to

This repo requiers an external downloader agent : uGet, which is freely available.
It currently only works for Linux (tested on Ubuntu)

Before running the repo use :


*sudo apt-get install uget*    #to get the uget downloader

*sudo apt-get install python-qt4* #to get the gui api

*sudo pip install selenium*	#to get the selenium webdrivers

*sudo apt-get install chromium-browser* #to get the chromium browser (It requires the chromium browser to access the site)

run:

*chmod +x dnld_support.sh*  #to allow executable permissions to the script


Then run the anime_downloader.py, enter the required details to get the anime downloaded
